# Violeta Petrović - Junior QA Extraordinaire

## 👋 Hello World!

I'm Violeta, a budding Junior QA Specialist with a knack for finding bugs and making developers (slightly) annoyed, but happier in the long run! 🎉

## 🔍 What I Do

- **Bug Hunting**: Finding those pesky bugs that hide in the shadows.
- **Test Case Writing**: Crafting test cases like a pro.
- **Automation Testing**: Making sure everything runs smoothly, even when I'm asleep.

## 🛠 Tools of the Trade

- **Manual Testing**: Because nothing beats a human touch.
- **Automation with Playwright**: Automating all the things.
- **API Testing with Postman**: APIs don’t scare me.
- **Jenkins**: Basic CI/CD knowledge to keep things flowing.
- **SQL**: Querying databases like it’s nobody’s business.
